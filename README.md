# Blood Donation Prediction API

* This is an API to run inference against a classification model.

* The model predicts whether a donor in certain conditions will donate blood or not. A prediction that can be critical in emergencies as it allows for targeting more potential donors, save time and therefore save lives!

* It takes as input: months since first donation, months since last donation, number of donations and total blood donated in cm^3.

* To try the API, just pull **marwenwn/blood_donation_prediction_api** image from Docker Hub and run it.
